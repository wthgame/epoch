# Epoch

> **noun:** a period of time in history or a person's life, typically one marked by notable events or particular characteristics.

Epoch is an all-in-one Roblox plugin for the next decade of tower building.
Epoch is composed of 5 subplugins:

-   Epoch Build is a set of modern building tools akin to F3X and SBS
-   Epoch Library is a library of copyable images, sounds, and insertable beams,
    particle emitters, and client objects
-   Epoch Inspect is a property panel that adds quality of life improvements,
    with documentation and support for client object configuration
-   Epoch Tools is a utility library that automates many tedious tasks in tower
    building
-   Epoch Project adds workspace/project management for both standalone towers
    and fangames with a library of insertable tower kits to begin with

Epoch sports first class support with many games, including: Eternal Towers of
Hell, Obren's Towers of Hell, Thai's Crazy Towers, Gawd's Awful Towers, and 
Welcome To Hell.

Finally, Epoch comes with an extension API for other plugins and tower builders
to implement it's own tooling, library assets, and even game architectures.
